Mindreading and Joint Action: Philosophical Tools

\section{Mindreading and Tracking}

\subsection{Mindreading}
Mindreading is the representation of mental states as the mental states of a particular subject.

To understand what mindreading is it might be helpful to reflect on what mental states are.

[NB: postpone empirical puzzles about mindreading until towards the end; use these to illustrate applications of the ideas.]


\subsection{Tracking mental states}
An ability to \textit{track} mental states of a particular kind (e.g. beliefs) is ability that exists in part because exercising it brings benefits obtaining which depends on exploiting or influencing facts about othersâ€™ mental states.
To track beliefs is to exercise a belief-tracking ability.

To illustrate, suppose that Hannah is able to discern whether another's eyes are in view, that Hannah exercises this ability to escape detection while stealing from others, that Hannah's ability exists in part because it benefits her in this way, and that Hannah's escaping detection depends on exploiting a fact about other's mental states (namely that they usually cannot see Hannah's acts of theft when Hannah doesn't have their eyes in view).
Then Hannah has a theory of mind ability. 
(This is not supposed to be a plausible, real-world example but only to illustrate what the definition requires.)

Sometimes tracking involves mindreading, but not always (as the story about Hannah and the eyes illustrates).

Tracking mental states without mindreading is probably quite common.  Another example: preening (?).


\section{What are mental states?}

mental state = 
	subject [e.g. Ayesah] 
	+ 
	attitude [e.g. desire] 
	+ 
	content [e.g. that Ayesha eats ice cream]

The subject is just an object.

Explain attitude & content using 2 x 2: 

	belief 			that Ayesha eats ice cream
	desire			that Frederique writes poetry


The attitude is normally specified by its functional and normative roles, and these are usually explained in contrast with those of other attitudes.
E.g. What distinguishes believing from supposing?  These have related roles in guiding action.  Velleman (*ref) suggests that believing differs from supposing in aiming at truth.  We'll return to this idea later.

To specify the content we first need to identify something about its structure.
Mental states are usually thought of as having propositional contents.
But there is a variety of types of content that a mental state can have.
For instance, you can have an attitude towards a map-like structure, an image, an event-type, an object or a relation.

***examples (e.g. use navigation for attitudes towards maps?)

*Explain what propositions are (like numbers).  
*Also explain different types of propositions (Russellian, Fregean &c)

*illustrate limits of different kinds of content (compare with different kinds of number)
